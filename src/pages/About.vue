      during the project we spoke with our momm's and asked from them the recipes that most represent our ethnic group.<br>
      daniel's mom told us that she chosen the recipes daniel likes the most specially the Pelmeni.<br>
      and ayalons mom gave us 3 recipes that represnt the yemenite side and the Iraqi side like the Cuba and Cubana.<br>

      <br>
      during this project we felt a lot of frustration when things didnt work but a lot of happines when we started to see the website starting to work.<br>
      i think we will start to use this ebsite daily to take ideas to recipes and make them for our friend and family.
